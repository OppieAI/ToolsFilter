| **Performance (2024)** | 2-5x faster than most competitors; 4x throughput improvement in v2.6 | Slower than competitors in recent benchmarks | Highest RPS, lowest latencies; 4x improvements in 2024 | 80K vectors/s indexing; sub-100ms query latency | Limited benchmarks available |
| **Memory Efficiency** | 72% reduction in v2.6; RaBitQ reduces to 1/32 size | Standard HNSW memory requirements | Built-in quantization reduces RAM by 97% | HNSW-IF hybrid approach optimizes memory | In-memory only, no optimization |
| **Clustering/Distribution** | Fully distributed, K8s-native, horizontal scaling | Sharding + replication with Raft consensus | Comprehensive sharding + replication | Advanced distributed architecture | Single-node only |
| **Language** | Go/C++ | Go | Rust | C++/Java | Python |
| **Production Users** | Salesforce, PayPal, Shopee, Airbnb, eBay, NVIDIA, IBM, AT&T | Strong in academia, growing enterprise adoption | Growing rapidly with $28M funding (2024) | Spotify (primary user), Yahoo | Mainly prototypes and small projects |
| **Ease of Deployment** | Moderate (distributed by default) | Moderate (GraphQL adds complexity) | Easy to moderate | Complex (full search engine) | Very easy (Python, single-node) |
| **Special Features** | Full-text search, GPU support, multiple index types | GraphQL API, hybrid search, knowledge graphs | Written in Rust, SIMD acceleration, async I/O | Full search engine + vector DB, ColPali support | Simple API, good for prototypes |
