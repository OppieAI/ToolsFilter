# Enhancement Plan: From Semantic Search to PTR Implementation

## Executive Summary

Our current implementation is a **semantic similarity-based tool search system**, while the PTR paper describes a **learning-based recommendation system** with historical pattern recognition, functional decomposition, and multi-view ranking. This document outlines the gap analysis and roadmap to evolve our system toward the full PTR architecture.

## Current State vs. PTR Target State

### What We Have: Semantic Search System

```
Query → Embedding → Vector Search → Threshold Filter → Top-K Tools
```

**Capabilities:**
- Semantic similarity matching using embeddings (OpenAI, Voyage, Gemini)
- Vector database storage (Qdrant)
- Threshold-based filtering with optimization
- Basic evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1)
- Multi-model support with fallback

**Limitations:**
- No learning from past interactions
- No understanding of tool relationships
- No query decomposition
- No redundancy detection
- Single-view ranking (semantic only)

### What PTR Requires: Intelligent Recommendation System

```
Query → Decomposition → Historical Patterns → Functional Mapping → Multi-view Ranking → Optimal Tool Set
```

## Gap Analysis: Missing Components

### 1. Three-Stage Architecture

#### Stage 1: Tool Bundle Acquisition (MISSING)
**What it does:** Learns from historical tool usage patterns to identify tools that work well together.

**Required Components:**
- Historical usage database
- Bundle learning algorithm
- Pattern mining system
- Success/failure tracking

**Implementation Requirements:**
```python
class ToolBundleAcquisition:
    def __init__(self):
        self.usage_history = []  # Store (query, tools_used, outcome)
        self.tool_bundles = {}   # Learned tool combinations

    def learn_bundles(self, min_support=0.1):
        # Mine frequent itemsets from usage history
        # Identify successful tool combinations
        pass

    def get_candidate_bundles(self, query):
        # Return historically successful bundles for similar queries
        pass
```

#### Stage 2: Functional Coverage Mapping (MISSING)
**What it does:** Decomposes queries into functional requirements and maps them to tools.

**Required Components:**
- Query decomposer
- Functionality extractor
- Requirement-tool mapper
- Coverage analyzer

**Implementation Requirements:**
```python
class FunctionalCoverageMapper:
    def decompose_query(self, query: str) -> List[FunctionalRequirement]:
        # Break query into atomic functional needs
        pass

    def map_requirements_to_tools(self, requirements, available_tools):
        # Create requirement-tool mapping matrix
        pass

    def analyze_coverage_gaps(self, mapping):
        # Identify unfulfilled requirements
        pass
```

#### Stage 3: Multi-view Re-ranking (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Current:** Only semantic alignment via embeddings
**Missing:** Historical correlation and contextual expansion

**Required Enhancements:**
```python
class MultiViewRanker:
    def rank_tools(self, query, candidate_tools):
        scores = {
            'semantic': self.semantic_alignment(query, tools),      # ✓ Implemented
            'historical': self.historical_correlation(query, tools), # ✗ Missing
            'contextual': self.contextual_expansion(query, tools)    # ✗ Missing
        }
        return self.combine_scores(scores)
```

### 2. TRACC Evaluation Metric (MISSING)

**Current Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1
**TRACC Requirements:**
- Penalize missing essential tools
- Penalize redundant tools
- Consider functional completeness
- Account for tool interdependencies

**Implementation Blueprint:**
```python
def calculate_tracc(recommended_tools, ground_truth_tools, query_requirements):
    # Functional coverage score
    coverage = calculate_requirement_coverage(recommended_tools, query_requirements)

    # Redundancy penalty
    redundancy = detect_redundant_tools(recommended_tools)

    # Missing tool penalty
    missing = identify_missing_essential_tools(ground_truth_tools, recommended_tools)

    # Interdependency score
    synergy = evaluate_tool_synergy(recommended_tools)

    return combine_tracc_components(coverage, redundancy, missing, synergy)
```

### 3. Historical Learning System (MISSING)

**Required Infrastructure:**
```sql
-- Usage History Table
CREATE TABLE tool_usage_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    query_id VARCHAR(255),
    query_text TEXT,
    query_embedding VECTOR(1536),
    tools_recommended JSON,
    tools_actually_used JSON,
    outcome VARCHAR(50), -- success/failure/partial
    execution_time_ms INT,
    user_feedback JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Tool Bundles Table
CREATE TABLE learned_tool_bundles (
    bundle_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    tool_ids JSON,
    support_count INT,
    success_rate FLOAT,
    common_query_patterns JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 4. Query Decomposition Module (MISSING)

**Architecture:**
```python
class QueryDecomposer:
    def __init__(self, llm_model="gpt-4"):
        self.llm = llm_model
        self.requirement_extractor = RequirementExtractor()

    def decompose(self, query: str) -> QueryDecomposition:
        # Use LLM to break down query
        components = self.llm.extract_components(query)

        # Identify functional requirements
        requirements = self.requirement_extractor.extract(components)

        # Determine operation sequence
        sequence = self.determine_operation_flow(requirements)

        return QueryDecomposition(
            components=components,
            requirements=requirements,
            sequence=sequence
        )
```

### 5. Tool Relationship Graph (MISSING)

**Data Structure:**
```python
class ToolRelationshipGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = nx.DiGraph()
        self.relationships = {
            'complements': {},     # Tools that work well together
            'substitutes': {},     # Tools that can replace each other
            'prerequisites': {},   # Tools that require other tools
            'conflicts': {}        # Tools that shouldn't be used together
        }

    def add_relationship(self, tool1, tool2, relationship_type, strength):
        self.graph.add_edge(tool1, tool2,
                          type=relationship_type,
                          weight=strength)

    def find_complementary_tools(self, tool):
        # Return tools that enhance this tool's functionality
        pass

    def detect_redundancy(self, tool_set):
        # Identify functionally duplicate tools
        pass
```

## Performance Targets

Based on PTR paper results, we should aim for:

| Metric | Current | Target | Improvement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| F1 Score | 0.65 | 0.80+ | +23% |
| TRACC | N/A | 0.75+ | New metric |
| Query Time | 1.2s | <500ms | -58% |
| Redundancy Rate | Unknown | <10% | Measure first |
| Coverage | Unknown | >95% | Measure first |

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Database Schema**: Need to add tables for historical data
2. **Caching Strategy**: Implement aggressive caching for bundles
3. **Async Processing**: Move learning to background jobs
4. **Model Training**: Set up continuous learning pipeline
5. **Monitoring**: Add detailed metrics for each component

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| LLM costs for decomposition | High | Cache decompositions, use smaller models |
| Storage for history | Medium | Implement data retention policies |
| Learning algorithm complexity | High | Start with simple patterns, iterate |
| Integration complexity | High | Phased rollout with feature flags |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Benchmark each component separately |

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: All three PTR stages implemented and working
2. **Performance**: Meet or exceed paper's reported improvements
3. **Operational**: System maintains <500ms response time at scale
4. **Quality**: TRACC score >0.75 on ToolBench dataset
5. **Learning**: Measurable improvement over time with usage

## Conclusion

Evolving from our current semantic search to full PTR implementation requires significant architectural changes. The primary focus should be on:

1. **Historical learning infrastructure** - Critical for all advanced features
2. **Query understanding** - Decomposition enables better tool selection
3. **Multi-view ranking** - Combines multiple signals for better recommendations
4. **Tool relationships** - Understanding how tools work together

This roadmap provides a path to incrementally build these capabilities while maintaining system stability and performance.


## Problems that I forsee
What are we solving?
- Recommend tools that will help assist the assistant and reach the solution faster.

Context (In the practical world):
User is having a conversation with the assistant (LLMs) and given the conversation and all the tools (MCP tools) that the user has enabled, we only want to filter or recommend the tools that will actually help the assistant solve the problem.

1. The tools (aka user tools or available tools) they have enabled is a subset of total tools (could be in 10000s), but we can only recommend tools that the user has enabled.
2. Our system will recommend tools out of the user tools, after each time the user puts in a query. We are trying to help the assistant by recommending tools that might be useful, and filter out noise.
3. Once we have recommended the tools: The only way we know the tool/s we recommended is/are helpful or useful is when the assistant uses it. If the tool doesn't get used, this doesn't mean what we recommended was wrong, it could be possible that assistant chooses to not use it. We definitely know the tool/s that were used by the assistants were helpful.
4. In short, The assistant can choose zero or more tools out of the recommended ones.

What all data we have or will have?
1. The conversation that is going on between the user and the assistant
2. The Tools has a defined signature, like name, description, required parameters, optional parameters.
3. Post recommendation, if the assistant uses the tools we will have data for that (which tool/s was used, etc).

Questions
1. How to solve this problem at scale? I would only like to use battle tested and well documented methods.
2. What happens if a tool is newly introduced? For our application we have a dynamic set of tools, new tools can be introduced during run time?
3. Won't the system favor old tools vs new tools, just because they have more data.
4. How do we maintain or pre-calculate this? given our tools can be in 10000s

think hard and wisely before answering my question.

4. I will question the rational of the logic (co-occurrence etc) as well, The only way we will if a tool is useful is if the LLM uses our recommendation but it could very well be that it was not applicable as well. Do we know how this kind of problem is solved in data science?
5. If we forget the PTR paper, how is think kind of problem solved in the industry? what is it called?
